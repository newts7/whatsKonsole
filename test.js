    KIET was a big step up surprise to Aishwarya Singh as all the 6 schools she’d been to, were your typical small town schools in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Gazipur, Baharich and Basti. She says she aces keeping good company and found some really sharp people across years in her time at KIET. She had fun and worked hard to get a 99.3%ile in CAT. She headed MDI Gurgaon’s International relations committee in her MBA and now is an HR manager with PepsiCo. She manages 1000+ people in Sales, North India.
